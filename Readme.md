# Shamir
Implementation of Shamir's secret sharing scheme.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing))

Shamir's secret sharing scheme is a threshold scheme which enables the user
to split a secret into `n` shares, while requiring any `k` shares to
reconstruct the original secret.

## TODO
* Add cmdline
* Switch to GF arithmetic
* Switch to encode/decode strings/byte arrays
